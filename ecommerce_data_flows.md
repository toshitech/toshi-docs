# E-commerce data flows

The image below shows an example of how the data flows between TOSHI and a brand or integrator in a typical integration with TOSHI for ecommerce.

The existing TOSHI connectors and plugins take care of the first four API calls in the process, but for bespoke integrations, it's a simple process to implement these endpoints.

TOSHI is also able to replace any order or label data API call with a CSV data transfer via a brand or integrator's SFTP site.
